Here's an example of how you can use Telethon and the client API to download files in parallel from Telegram and upload them using rclone:

```python
from telethon import TelegramClient
import requests
import asyncio

api_id = 'YOUR_API_ID'
api_hash = 'YOUR_API_HASH'
client = TelegramClient('session_name', api_id, api_hash)

async def download_file(file, dlMsg):
    # Send a message indicating that the download has started
    await client.edit_message(dlMsg, f'Download started for {file.name}..')
    
    # Define the progress callback function
    def progress_callback(current, total):
        progress = int(current / total * 100)
        speed = current / (time.time() - start_time)
        await client.edit_message(dlMsg, f'Downloading {file.name}.. {progress}% \n {speed}Mb/s')
    
    # Start the download
    start_time = time.time()
    filePath = f'~/videos/plex/{file.name}'
    await client.download_media(file, filePath, progress_callback=progress_callback)
    
    # Send a message indicating that the upload has started
    await client.edit_message(dlMsg, f'Upload started for {file.name}..')
    
    # Send a request to the rclone API to move the file
    url = 'http://rclone_api_address/operations/movefile'
    params = {
        'srcFs': filePath,
        'srcRemote': file.name,
        'dstFs': 'crypt:Torrents/Telegram/',
        'dstRemote': file.name,
        '_async': True
    }
    response = requests.post(url, params=params)
    jobid = response.json()['jobid']
    
    # Watch the progress and speed of the upload
    while True:
        response = requests.get(f'http://rclone_api_address/job/status/{jobid}')
        status = response.json()
        if status['finished']:
            break
        progress = status['progress']
        speed = status['speed']
        await client.edit_message(dlMsg, f'Uploading {file.name}.. {progress}% \n {speed}Mb/s')
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    # Send a message indicating that the upload was successful
    await client.edit_message(dlMsg, f'{file.name} uploaded successfully!')

# Example usage
async with client:
    dlMsg = await client.send_message('me', 'Download started..')
    files = [...]  # List of files to download
    await asyncio.gather(*[download_file(file, dlMsg) for file in files])
```

This code creates an asynchronous function `download_file` that takes a `file` and a `dlMsg` as arguments. The function sends a message indicating that the download has started and defines a progress callback function to update the `dlMsg` with the download progress and speed. It then starts the download using `client.download_media` and updates the `dlMsg` when the download is complete.

Next, the function sends a message indicating that the upload has started and sends a request to the rclone API to move the file. It watches the progress and speed of the upload using the `/job/status` endpoint and updates the `dlMsg` accordingly. Finally, it sends a message indicating that the upload was successful.

The example usage shows how you can use this function to download multiple files in parallel using `asyncio.gather`.

Note that you'll need to replace `'YOUR_API_ID'`, `'YOUR_API_HASH'`, `'session_name'`, and `'http://rclone_api_address'` with your own values.
